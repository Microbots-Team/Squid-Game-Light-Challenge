# Squid-Game- 🟢🔴 Light-Challenge
 
A fast-paced multiplayer game inspired by the iconic **Squid Game – Red Light, Green Light** challenge.  
The game is built using **GDevelop**, while real-world player controls are handled through an **Arduino-based 4-button controller**, allowing up to four players to race simultaneously.

Players can advance only when the **green light** appears…  
But when it switches to **red**, they must freeze—any movement during the red phase results in elimination.  
The project blends physical interaction with digital gameplay for a fun, competitive experience.

## 💡 Project Overview
This project recreates the Red Light–Green Light mechanic in a digital game environment while keeping the familiar tension and excitement of the original concept.  
The game logic is developed using **GDevelop**, and four physical push buttons connect to an **Arduino**, serving as controllers for four different players.

Each player races toward the finish line by pressing their button rapidly during green light phases.  
During red light phases, pressing the button causes an immediate penalty or elimination.  
This combination of **game engine + real hardware** creates an engaging hybrid experience.
